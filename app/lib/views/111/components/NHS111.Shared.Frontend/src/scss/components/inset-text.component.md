name: Inset text

This extends the nhsuk-frontend's inset text component and allows for changes specific to 111, such as border color for important information.

## Example

<div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-inset-text--red">
  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The 999 operator will check if you need an ambulance.</h2>
  <p>They will also ask:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>for your phone number</li>
      <li>where you are</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you don’t need an ambulance you’ll get advice on what to do instead.</p>
</div>
