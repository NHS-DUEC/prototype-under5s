Hint - resize the viewport to see these utilities working.

Content that's not currently visible is hidden with `display: none` and so duplicated content doesn't negatively impact screenreader users.

<div class="app-u-small-screen-only">This should only display on small screens, below tablet sizes.</div>
<div class="app-u-large-screen-only">This should only display on large screens, tablet sizes and above.</div>
