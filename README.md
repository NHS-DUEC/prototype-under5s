# NHS prototype kit for 111 Online

This is forked template repository for the NHS Prototype Kit but with some specific 111 Online additions and tweaks. We endevour to maintain parity with releases to the official version of the prototype kit.

Support for this version of the kit is limited. We recommend you visit the <a href="https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk">NHS prototype kit site</a> to read the documentation.

## About the NHS prototype kit

The NHS prototype kit enables you to make interactive prototypes that will look like pages on NHS.UK and related services such as 111.nhs.uk. The prototypes you make are a great way to show ideas to others and for conducting user research.

## Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they must be protected by a <a href="https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos/publish-your-prototype-online">username and password</a>. This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like NHS.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
